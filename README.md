# About
A website for creating and signing up for clubs and, minimizing the amount of overlap between clubs. Created by FCS Coding Club.

# Running
The repository is set up to work right in replit.com. Just press the run button, and wait until all the dependencies install. 
Note: Since replit's web preview is loaded in an iframe, it will block you from registering and logging in. To get around this,
open the preview in a new tab.
## Running from terminal (locally)
```
python3 setup.py
python3 run.py
```
